##About me

father to my son, Hunter, and with my beautiful wife and fantastic mother, Kaylin, living in the UK, avid hobbyist!

enjoying all aspects of life, photography, archery, motorcycling, aquariums, astronomy, and ofcourse, computers!

I have been coding AHK and been an active member of the AHK irc community for over 10 years but rarely actually shared my code! i never really considered that anyone else would want to use them until now, so here we are, the first in a string of releases!

Ofcourse, these scripts take time, with my longest project taking over 8 years and 2mb of hand-written code!
this particular project took me aprx 7-8 hours of casual coding, could probably be crushed into 2-3 hours!
i just do this for fun, mainly because i hate charging people money for my work as we all have different financial means, so i always prefer to charge people however much it is worth to them, maybe it's $10, maybe it's $0! it doesn't matter! so long as this software isn't put out of your reach simply due to money, like other more greedy developers!
for this reason, none of my assistance or software costs money, and it never will! it's all free, with no adverts other than a single convenient, unobtrusive "support me" link.

Any money we receive will go straight towards bettering my sons life in any way we can!
